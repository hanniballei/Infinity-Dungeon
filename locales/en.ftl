                                  - Fight random monsters, collect $INFD💰 and powerful equipments NFT, and continue to explore deeper Dungeon
                                  - ⚠️ Only $INFD tokens and equipment NFT can be taken away from the dungeon, other bonuses/props are only valid in the on-going adventure;
                                  - You need to pay 50% of the $INFD💰 collected during the current adventure to the Scavenger as a tip for taking you out of Dungeon (No matter you are dead or alive);
                                  - During the adventure, there will be random events:
                                    1. Ruins
                                    You have a chance to obtain a large amount of $INFD💰, increase/decrease the upper limit of blood volume, increase/decrease the upper limit of attack power, increase/decrease the upper limit of defense power, increase the probability of critical hit/defense, etc
                                    2. Black Market
                                    You can purchase props/equipments at black market, or enhance current equipments

                                    Fight your way out! The mechanics of fighting are determined by the randomness of rolling dice. The speed for both sides determines who attacks first. Both attack and defense actions require rolling dice to determine the damage range caused, or the damage range of effective defense. If you're lucky, you can kill the monster in one hit. If you're unlucky, your attacks hurt like tickling! Good luck, adventurer!
